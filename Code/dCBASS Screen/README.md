# dCBASS Screen
This folder contains the code to analyse raw OD600 data from Figure 1. The data can be found at Brenzinger2024/Data/dCBASS Screen.

Based on the data from the plate reader, the screen pipeline will do all data processing, plotting, calculations, and statistical analysis. 
It needs two accessory files (`Map.txt` and `ExampleDatabase.txt`) to be able to attribute drugs, concentrations, and strains to the respective plates and wells.
